# Single Icon Prompt

**Attach the reference image, then use this prompt:**

---

Recreate this app icon:
- Remove the rounded square background
- Keep just the logo/symbol floating on transparency
- Simplify slightly for small size display (16-32px)
- Crisp edges, no blur
- Keep the original brand colours
- Output: 128x128 PNG, transparent background

If the icon has a complex container (like a screen or frame), extract only the most recognisable element (mascot, symbol, etc.) and render that accurately.
